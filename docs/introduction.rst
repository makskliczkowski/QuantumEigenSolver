Scientific Background
---------------------

The methods implemented in QES are based on established theoretical frameworks:

**Neural Quantum States**
   Neural quantum states, introduced by Carleo and Troyer [1]_, represent quantum many-body wavefunctions using artificial neural networks. This approach has shown remarkable success in capturing complex quantum correlations and ground state properties.

**Variational Monte Carlo**
   The variational principle combined with Monte Carlo sampling provides a powerful framework for approximating ground states and computing expectation values of quantum observables.

**Symmetry Integration**
   QES incorporates quantum symmetries (translational, point group, particle number conservation) to reduce computational complexity and improve accuracy.
