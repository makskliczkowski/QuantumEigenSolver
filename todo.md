Here, we place current todos.

## Project: Fading ergodicity and the random matrix ensembles

- [x] Check whether $\sigma_t ^2 $ is always $\leq P_s$ for the initial states in the eigenbasis. For that take the participation that we have and do the size scaling.
- [ ] Check how the LDOS looks like for the UM model. Plot it as a function of $\gamma$
- [ ] Check whether weighted time average in Eq.(18) is necessary
- [x] Check whether temporal fluctuations depend on the choice of initial time $t_0$.
- [ ] Check slopes of the power spectrum.
- [ ] Check the exact Eq.(28) computation in the same bins as the f-function
- [ ] Check whether the spectral function changes when evaluated over whole spectrum - choose single parameter $\gamma$.
- [ ] Check whether the product remains the same...
- [ ] Run more realisations...

## Project: Non-gaussianity

- [ ] Optimize calculation of the entanglement entropies for the quadratic systems. They seem to be so slow now!

# Project: Reinforced agent


## PhD thesis
- [ ] Create plots for the power-law random banded and the AGPs. See what was calculated and start working on the last part of Chapter 4. For that we need:
    - [ ] f-functions of the PLRB
    - [ ] $\chi ^{\rm av} / \chi ^{\rm ETH}$, $\chi ^{\rm typ} / \chi ^{\rm ETH}$
    - [ ] $\eta (a)$ vs $\varepsilon$
    - [ ] mobility edge for other models
- [ ] Start writing the non-gaussianity part in the PhD thesis and add some results. Just a tiny bit.
- [ ] Write something about reinforced agent, add data...
