# Quantum Eigensolver

This project provides a comprehensive framework for simulating quantum systems using various models and functionalities. The project leverages advanced mathematical libraries and parallel computing techniques to ensure efficient and accurate simulations.

It is a general solver for physical Hamiltonians. The work is in progress. Currently, the solver includes:
- ED solutions to multiple Hamiltonians on the Lattice or Hilbert space graphs. This includes standard spin systems and random Hamiltonians. The software also enables solutions to quadratic Hamiltonians with multithreaded correlation matrices calculation.
- Implementation of point and global symmetries for the systems.
- the variational Quantum Monte Carlo solver for ansatz ground (and excited) states with RBM and RBM-PP ansatzes.
